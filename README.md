3DS Power Off Cartridge Slot
============================
This 3DS homebrew **powers off the 3DS cartridge slot** and can enable it again. This **does not survive a reboot** and the cartridge slot gets **re-enabled when you re-insert a cartridge**. Please make sure to run this **with a Custom Firmware**. Useful for flashcard users!
